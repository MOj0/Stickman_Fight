# Stickman Fight

The online multiplayer game Stickman Fight was made as a project for the Computer Graphics class. We used WebGL for 3D graphics and socket.io for networking.

The game can be played here: https://intense-lowlands-40528.herokuapp.com

You can also run it locally, [here](#instructions) are the instructions on how to do so.

# Instructions

To play the game, run the following command in the root of the project: `node GameServer.js`. Note: for some reason this command doesn't work in the standard Command Prompt (Windows), so you will have to use PowerShell.
To install any missing dependencies run: `npm i`. Open the following link in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:7777/index.html
